     - **Shareable Reports**: Easily share with stakeholders, vendors, or auditors without needing access to private repositories.
     - **Regulatory Ready**: Delivered in a standardized format to simplify compliance and audits.
   - **CVE Summaries**: Enriched insights into security vulnerabilities, categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, etc.).
   - **Docker Image Metadata**: Detailed information such as image digest (`sha256`), creation date, and size for version control and traceability.
   - **Provenance Artifacts**: Clear records of updates and risks to support debugging, compliance, and long-term tracking.

2. **Community Support**: A space to ask questions, report issues, and share feedback.
